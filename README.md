# Description

This repository serves as a compilation of instructions for the Keebio Iris Phoenix Edition (PE) keyboard, encompassing revisions 5 to 8. It is meant to gather all the information needed to build and configure your Keebio Iris keyboard all in one place. The original authors of all the files and documents used will be linked to in the [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements).

# Parts List

**An important note regarding the top plate:** since the top plate is responsible for holding the switches in place it is not advisable to 3D print it since the final piece could lack in rigidity and cause for an unpleasant typing experience but the STL file will also be linked.
